# kadvent-2023

Welcome to `kadvent-2023`, a repository of my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles, implemented in Kotlin. 
### About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is released. The puzzles cover a broad range of programming concepts and provide a fun way to practice coding skills.

### Project Structure

This project is structured as follows:

- Each day's puzzles are solved in separate Kotlin files, named according to the day (e.g., `Day1.kt`, `Day2.kt`, etc.).
- Input data for each puzzle is stored in the `resources` directory.
